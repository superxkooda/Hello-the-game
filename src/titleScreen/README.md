<h1>TitleScreen Class</h1>
<p>
The only function of this cluass will be to bring up the title screen
</p>
<p>
This is not supposed to bring up the main menu or even start the game.<br> 
I want the calling functionto handle that
</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<p>- boil the title screen class down to only the title screen</p>
<p>- seperate the data from the functions</p>
<p>- prepare the class for the data to be loaded from files for when that does happen</p>
